GoogleCodeJam
=============

Solution code for Google Code Jam problems

This project contains a number of solutions to Google Code Jam problems.  It implements an abstract class GoogleCodeJam that does the IO necessary to read input and write output and determine the number of test cases in the input.  The subclasses then implement a solve() method which returns a solution for each individual case and this is output to both System.out and an output file.
